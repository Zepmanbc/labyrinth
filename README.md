# Labyrinthe

---

## 1. Presentation

I made this Maze game to learn python and pygame.

There is 3 sizes of mazes, each is generated randomly. the Goal is to reach the treasure with the less moves (not a big challenge...). The treasure is positionned at the end of the longuest path.

## 2. Installation

> git clone https://github.com/Zepmanbc/labyrinth.git

> cd labyrinth

create a virtual environment
> virtualenv env -p python3

## 3. How to play
