# Labyrinthe

---

## 1. Presentation

I made this Maze game to learn python and pyganme.

There is 3 sizes of mazes, each is generated randomly. the Goal is to reach the treasure with the less moves (not a big chalenge...). The treasure is positionned at the end of the longuest path.

> git clone 

go in the folder
> cd labyrinth

create a virtual environment
> virtualenv env -p python3
